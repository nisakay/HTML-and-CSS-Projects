 <p>My name is Nisa Kayoulou, but everyone call me Isaac. I'm originally from Conngo a small country in central africa. Since my young age I was always attracted by technology I liked the fact of fixing stuff and people always came to me for answers about anything related to technology. Today I consider myself as an aspiring sofware developer, I want to be the able to help others with my creativity by using technology.But other than my love for technology I also love dogs, Today we consider dogs as our everyday companion.</p>
